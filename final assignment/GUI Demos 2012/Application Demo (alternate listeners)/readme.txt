Note:

This program is different than Connect Four:
1) The main frame and the panel are in the same file
1) The code for the listeners for the Menu items is connected directly
to each Menu item instead of using an actionPerformed method.
2) The JPanel uses a MouseAdapter, MouseMotionAdapter and KeyAdapter instead
of Listeners - unused methods don't need to be included
